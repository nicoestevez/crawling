boroughs had entirely disappeared, leaving pocket boroughs owned by a single person, who chose the representative himself. Members of the House of Commons did not have to live in the districts that sent them, and most members were landed gentlemen whose social and economic interests overlapped with the hereditary members of the House of Lords. Others represented financial interests in the city --- of London, but Walpole made sure these interests did not clash, so no fundamental power struggles disrupted the harmony of British government. Aggressively promoting Britain’s commerce, Walpole laid the basis for a future acceleration of economic development that came to be called the Industrial Revolution. Founded in 1694, the powerful Bank of England already existed to facilitate government borrowing, but with firm support from financiers, Walpole strengthened it and made reliable payments on the sizable national debt. The mercantilist empire approached its heyday, harvesting profits from a worldwide network of colonies and business partners that stretched from Hudson’s Bay to the Caribbean, and from African trading posts to the subcontinent of India. Walpole also created a large navy to protect British shipping and a professional standing army to deploy at will on land. The British people paid heavy taxes for these costly measures, but the government could always borrow more money in times of war or other emergency because Walpole had made government bonds a supremely secure investment. In accordance with the Glorious Revolution, the British government continued to respect the personal liberty of individual subjects more fully than any other monarchy in Europe, but the majority of Britons had no vote in elections and no significant voice in the government. Hungry laborers could riot from time to time, but the government did not depend on their approval. Subsequent kings and ministers followed Walpole’s example, so British society and government became far more stable in the eighteenth century than it was in the seventeenth. Politically active Englishmen liked to believe that the balance of king, Lords, and Commons created this stability, but it actually resulted from a fundamental consensus among the governing classes and the undisputed control of Parliament by the Crown and its ministers. ### THE OPPOSITION TRADITION Not all Englishmen were satisfied with Walpole’s version of balanced government. A small group of disenchanted radicals hated the manipulation of elections, the high taxes, and the corrupt distribution of jobs and favors that the government routinely used to control the House of Commons. Deeply distrustful of human nature, they were certain that strong ministers would always use their powers for personal gain instead of the public welfare. Abuses would breed more --- abuses, taxes would skyrocket, elections would become meaningless, and a standing army would crush dissent. Freedom’s only hope, they argued, was a truly balanced government overseen by a virtuous and hypervigilant populace. Without immediate and radical reforms, corruption would overwhelm the kingdom and liberty would perish. Foremost among these self-styled Real Whigs were John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon, authors of a series of essays signed “Cato,” which first appeared in newspapers between 1720 and 1723 and were followed by at least six bound editions before 1755. Also calling themselves the Country Party (in opposition to Walpole’s Court Party), Trenchard and Gordon and a vocal band of imitators sang the praises of British liberty, calling it “the divine source of all human happiness,” but endlessly warned that it hung by a thread. “Liberty chastises and shortens Power,” they cautioned, “therefore Power would extinguish Liberty; and consequently Liberty has always exceeding cause to be jealous, and always upon her Defence.” To safeguard liberty, Trenchard and Gordon stressed the importance of public virtue, or the willingness to sacrifice personal interests for the good of all. In their minds, self-indulgent citizens would readily surrender their liberties in exchange for immoral personal benefits ranging from frivolity and vice to corruption and government favoritism. Without strict public virtue, they pleaded, liberty would be lost. Generally satisfied with their government, most influential Englishmen dismissed such alarms, but many Americans read them eagerly. Wide distribution of property, relatively simple lifestyles, and feisty colonial assemblies made free Americans especially proud of their liberty and virtue, while the arbitrary power and seductive allure of royal government might threaten them both. Far from the seats of real power, even the most powerful Americans easily believed in conspiracies against them. Their newspapers reprinted selections from *Cato’s Letters* endlessly and bound copies appeared in over one-third of American private libraries. Politically active colonists repeatedly invoked Cato’s ideas to justify resistance to imperial policies. For most of the eighteenth century, they did not go on to reject royal power altogether, but when relations with Britain turned sour, they would blend English radical suspicions with the revolutionary ideas of John Locke to interpret the crisis and prescribe a remedy. The radical, or Real Whig, tradition appealed to colonists who could read, vote, and freely participate in public affairs, but it was not the only cultural framework available for resisting established authority. Below the ranks of land-owning white men were thousands of --- artisans, wage earners, tenants, sailors, and laborers who claimed the rights of freeborn Englishmen even though they might not vote or read political theories. They usually deferred, or submitted, to upper-class rule, but in return, they expected the authorities to treat them fairly and preserve a moral economy, or decent conditions for the poor. When the elite failed in these duties, as in times of famine or oppressive taxation, for example, poor people in England, America, and continental Europe often formed crowds or mobs to protest and correct their grievances. These crowds could include women, free blacks, and young people as well as adult white men. Up to a point, the authorities often tolerated such outbursts and acted on their complaints, believing that stable government required a minimum level of popular support. In this irregular fashion, even the poorest free subjects thus claimed the right to influence public affairs. In times of political crisis, these crowd actions could bring elite and popular protesters together. # BALANCED GOVERNMENT IN THE COLONIES With all their suspicions of centralized power, colonial Americans still shared British enthusiasm for parliamentary supremacy, the Protestant succession, the House of Hanover, and the freedom and stability they seemed to produce. The widespread enslavement of Africans radically contradicted their boasts of British liberty, but few whites seemed troubled. Their own colonial governments shared many features of Britain’s constitution that they were quick to magnify. The royal or proprietary governors were obviously the local representatives of the king, and the governors’ councils, appointed from the very wealthiest and most distinguished colonial families, resembled the House of Lords. The elected assemblies were apparently analogous to the House of Commons, and colonials made much of their power to initiate legislation, to control their own membership, to approve all public taxes, and to control all public expenditures. The king’s ministers and governors scoffed at these claims. So far as they were concerned, the colonial assemblies were inferior local bodies more like boards of village aldermen than the august House of Commons. Without the will or resources to create a large imperial bureaucracy like Spain’s, it was more convenient to leave the colonials in charge of their own local affairs, but that was not at all the same as conceding that the assemblies had equal powers with Parliament itself. In 1760, Governor Arthur Dobbs of North Carolina reported with mixed anger and incredulity that “the Assembly think themselves entitled to --- all the Priviledges of a British House of Commons and therefore ought not submit to His majesty’s honorable Privy Council further than the Commons do in England, or to submit to his Majesty’s instructions to His Governor and Council here.” Despairing of proper government under such conditions, Dobbs demanded more power to “oppose and suppress a republican spirit of Independency rising in this colony.” Like other governors, he was largely disappointed, for most British ministers had more important things to worry about. London expected governors to control their assemblies. In Britain itself, the Hanoverian kings abandoned their personal control of legislation, including the power to veto acts of Parliament, and relied on their ministers to cajole or manipulate the lawmakers to obtain the results they wanted. The case was far different in the colonies, where governors used the veto with great frequency, and the Crown often disallowed, or vetoed, laws that the governor had approved. Colonial governors could also call and dismiss assemblies without restraint, demand new elections or forbid them as they wished, and exercise far more powers over courts than the Crown claimed in Britain. Royal governors provoked endless controversy when they tried to flex these executive muscles. About a fifth of them were born in America, but most were career bureaucrats or the needy relatives of some powerful person in Britain. They were usually honest and conscientious, but frequently knew little or nothing about America. They typically arrived at their posts with a sheaf of official instructions about what they were supposed to accomplish and how they were to go about it, but eventually clashed with their assemblies and found that their supposedly extensive powers were difficult to exercise. Unlike the ministers back home, governors lacked authority to entice assemblymen with offers of jobs and patronage. Unpopular governors could also face dismissal, as resentful colonial leaders pulled every string they could find to undermine their standing with the home government. It was therefore very difficult for the typical governor to gain an assembly’s compliance without granting equal or greater concessions in return. Unlike Britain, moreover, colonial society was often bitterly divided. Backcountry representatives frequently wanted more protection against Indians and coastal towns wanted to avoid the expense of war. Ambitious speculators wanted handsome land grants and their rivals wanted to stop them. Religious dissenters quarreled with the established church. A faction from one section of a colony struggled with enemies from another over place and preferment, and so on. Also in contrast to Britain, many of the malcontents could vote, --- for land was so cheap that many colonists could meet the property requirements for the suffrage. Historians estimate that as many as one-half to three-quarters of free white men in America could cast a ballot, while the corresponding number in Britain was no more than one-third. Enfranchised Americans also had closer ties to their elected representatives than most Britons had, for their assembly districts were more equally apportioned and assemblymen were more likely to live among their constituents. While the eighteenth-century British Parliament was a model of stability and decorum, quarrels with governors and among internal factions bitterly split its colonial counterparts. Most of the time, governors and assemblies reached the agreements they needed. Many assemblies controlled the governor’s salary and refused to pay it without his cooperation. Others could make generous land grants to governors who pleased them. The endless cycle of colonial wars forced governors to go repeatedly to assemblies with requests for men and money, and assemblies demanded recognition of their powers before granting the supplies. Successful governors learned to play one faction of the assembly against another or grant the majority’s demands in exchange for cooperation. “A governor is no sooner appointed than the first question is, Into whose hands shall I throw myself?” wrote one experienced veteran in 1752. “The answer is ready, Into whose but such as can best manage the Assembly. Hence prime ministers and courtiers are established, and, of course, anti-courtiers.” In the course of these disputes, the gentlemen who dominated the assemblies grew accustomed to thinking of themselves as the real rulers of their own colonies, despite the grumbles of their governors. They consistently thought of themselves as loyal and dutiful subjects of the British Crown and contented members of the larger empire, but regarded local control of colonial society as their fundamental right. This assumption would eventually drive them away from the king and toward an American republic. * British North America changed a great deal between the twin crises of Metacom’s War and Bacon’s Rebellion in the late seventeenth century and the eve of the Seven Years’ War in 1756. Colonies that had not even existed in 1676 had grown and flourished. Extravagant blueprints for imaginary utopias had given way to more practical arrangements --- worked out by endless negotiation. Most important from a political standpoint, colonists and administrators had absorbed many lessons from England’s Glorious Revolution and attempted to apply them to colonial conditions. The results were a ragged and uneven approximation of Britain’s balanced government that combined popular liberties with centralized powers for protecting trade, but leading colonists took pride in this achievement. Though they frequently quarreled with specific imperial demands, they cherished their membership in the British Empire. The triumph of William and Mary seemed to settle the most pressing issues of colonial governance and identity. Eighteenth-century Americans shifted their attention to economic concerns, and varied local resources brought diverse ways of life to different regions. The population of the thirteen mainland colonies would grow dramatically by immigration and natural increase until it almost reached two million whites and blacks. Distinct societies emerged in the South, the middle colonies, and New England, yet the colonies shared common features that resembled and contrasted with conditions in Britain. A provincial elite appeared everywhere, with free subordinates enjoying a simple but substantial prosperity below them. Proud of their achievements, few if any colonists guessed that their loyalty to the British Empire would be strained past the breaking point by events in the third quarter of the eighteenth century. --- STOWAGE OF THE BRITISH SLAVE SHIP BROOKES UNDER THE REGULATED SLAVE TRADE Act of 1788.

About the year 1735, Broteer Furro had been a six-year-old boy who later remembered his father as “Prince of the tribe of Dukandarra,” somewhere in the interior of West Africa. The Dukandarra had paid invaders to escape attack, but the raiders struck anyway. Broteer watched helplessly from a thicket of reeds as his father fought bravely but alone until he was finally overpowered. Dragging the boy from his hiding place, the attackers beat him, bound him with the women and other children, and tortured his father to death. Marched overland for months by his African captors and finally delivered to the waiting slave ships, Broteer and his family were among 12 million victims of the African slave trade. Like the Dukandarra, whole nations disappeared in a dragnet for human lives that continued from the mid-fifteenth century to the late nineteenth. Most of those who survived the notorious Middle Passage across the Atlantic Ocean came to the Caribbean or Latin America, but as many as half a million reached British North America, mostly before 1770. Broteer was among them. A ship’s officer bought him as a personal servant and gave him the new name Venture, because his purchase was a private investment. That act may have saved the boy from confinement in the filth and stench that others endured belowdecks, where smallpox killed 60 out of 260 captives on the transatlantic voyage. Eventually it brought him to his master’s home in Rhode Island instead of the others’ destination, the cane fields of Barbados. As a man, Venture became famous for his size, strength, and diligence. He used these gifts to “hire his time”—that is, to pay his owners for the privilege of working independently—and to save enough from his remaining wages to buy freedom for himself, his wife Marget, and --- their three children. Taking the surname of his last master, Venture Smith toiled for years as a farmhand and a woodcutter and later as a shipowner and farmer. Often cheated by customers who scorned to pay a black man, Venture Smith still secured three houses and 100 acres of good farmland in Haddam Neck, Connecticut, before his death in 1805. His memoirs circulated widely for the rest of the nineteenth century. The remarkable life of Venture Smith was part of the extraordinary growth of the eighteenth-century British colonies. Like many of the new Americans who arrived between 1700 and 1770, Smith came as a slave. Unlike the vast majority of his peers, however, he won his freedom and used it to approximate the success that free Europeans sought when they crossed the ocean voluntarily. Capping his father’s achievements with patriotic service, Smith’s son Solomon even fought for his country’s liberty in the War for Independence. The experience of Venture Smith thus combined slavery and freedom, starkly contrasting aspects of America’s colonial history. The America of Venture Smith had rapidly changed since the Glorious Revolution of 1688–1689. Its population grew dramatically, both from the large families of existing settlers and from free and unfree newcomers. Immigrants brought more social and cultural diversity to the colonies, and distinct regional economies and cultures took shape along the Atlantic seaboard. The Chesapeake and Carolina colonists created tobacco and rice plantations whose slaves produced most of the colonies’ exports. The middle colonies of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware welcomed thousands of Europeans to growing towns and cities or to their own small farms. New England also fostered productive farms and active commerce, giving Venture Smith his business opportunities, but growth and prosperity strained its Puritan heritage. The eighteenth-century colonies faced an array of social and cultural challenges. Colonial assemblies governed slaves with labor codes that had no European precedents. Prosperity brought increased opportunities for some, but also sustained a clear social hierarchy. A growing population depended very directly on the presence of women and families, and inspired corresponding laws, ideas, and customs that did derive from English precedents. Eager to share in a broader intellectual community, leading colonists absorbed new ideas about the role of reason and science in human life and embraced the opportunity to join a transatlantic movement called the Enlightenment. Americans --- also launched a revival of Protestant Christianity that blended vitality and stability amid unsettling change. # A Changing Population Britain’s American colonies expanded dramatically in the three-quarters of a century before the American Revolution, growing from a quarter million inhabitants in 1700 to about 2.5 million in 1775. Much of this growth came from natural increase, as families were large and settlers lived longer, but over half a million people were newcomers. Almost half were captive Africans like Venture Smith, but slightly more came from Europe, especially Britain, Ireland, and Germany. The fate of African exiles would be far different from that of the Europeans, but their contributions to the colonies’ society and economy were equally unmistakable. The new Americans added striking diversity to the colonial population and ensured that the future nation would not become a replica of England but a distinctive society of its own. ### IMMIGRANTS FROM EUROPE New migrants dramatically changed the ethnic composition of the colonial population. Most of the seventeenth-century settlers had been English, but a careful recent estimate suggests that England provided less than 8 percent of the migrants between 1700 and 1775, while 14 percent came from Germany, 18 percent from Ireland, 6 percent from Scotland, 5 percent from Wales, and the rest from Africa. About 40 percent of the roughly 300,000 European immigrants were bound servants of some kind, including some 50,000 British convicts. The largest group of migrants from continental Europe came from Germany, especially from the Palatinate, a mostly Protestant region along the Rhine River whose nobles were pressing for higher rents and feudal dues. When Britain welcomed foreign Protestants to its mainland colonies, as many as 84,000 Palatines and other Germans accepted the invitation. As the first cohort established themselves, they urged their friends and relatives to follow, creating a pattern of chain migration that brought repeated waves of settlers from the same
