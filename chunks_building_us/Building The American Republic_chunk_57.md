many men in that summer, but could not afford to spare them. Constantly marching left to get around Lee’s right, Grant kept forcing his opponent southward until Lee dug in on the eastern side of Richmond. There the armies entered a long and miserable siege in which Grant kept pushing to the south and west and defenders stretched thinner and thinner between the capital and nearby Petersburg. The approach of the 1864 fall elections saw both armies deadlocked at Atlanta and Richmond. Stalemate favored the South by demonstrating the Confederacy’s survival and the Union’s failure. Both sides were tired of futile bloodshed, and peace candidates railed against the folly --- of continued war. In the North, eager Democrats nominated General George B. McClellan to challenge Lincoln for the presidency, and hinted that he might end the war by agreeing to Confederate independence. Anxious to broaden their support, Republicans reached out to War Democrats by briefly renaming themselves the National Union Party and nominating Senator Andrew Johnson of Tennessee, a unionist Democrat and the only senator from a seceding state who remained in Congress throughout the war, for vice president. Even so, Lincoln glumly prepared himself for defeat. Suddenly, on September 2, Atlanta’s defenses cracked open and Sherman’s troops poured into a flaming city. Lincoln and the Republicans swept to victory on this news, and the North’s determination revived. Atlanta’s defenders retreated to Tennessee, but Sherman did not follow. Instead he attacked the fabric of slaveholding society by leading his army across Georgia in its famous March to the Sea. Without external supplies, his 62,000 men fed themselves by foraging 25 miles in each direction along the way. Delighted to despoil the slavocracy, Sherman’s “bummers” destroyed everything of military value, quite a bit of everything else, and helped themselves to considerable personal property. Trying to keep his men within limits, Sherman still shrugged off all but the worst excesses, reasoning that the war would never end until southern whites paid a personal price for their rebellion. As in other theaters, thousands of slaves rushed to join the Union advance. Whole families rejoiced in the “Day of Jubilee,” and men enlisted eagerly in the army of liberation. After reaching Savannah, Sherman turned northward to inflict an even harsher thrashing on the arch-rebels of South Carolina. He took Columbia on February 17, 1865, and fires jointly fed by Union, Confederate, and African American hands quickly consumed the capital. Without a pause, Sherman moved on to North Carolina, sweeping before him a tiny Confederate force under General Joseph Johnston. By April 1865, he was poised in Raleigh, North Carolina, hoping for news from Virginia. "TO FINISH THE WORK WE ARE IN" As federal troops closed in, the Confederacy punctuated its impending defeat with a bitter debate over slavery. Was it possible, some asked, that extreme military necessity might justify arming the slaves, even with the promise of freedom in return? After all, a Mississippi editor --- had reasoned in 1863, "It is better for us to use the negroes for our defense than that the Yankees should use them against us. . . . Although slavery is one of the principles that we started to fight for," he acknowledged, "if it proves an insurmountable obstacle to the achievement of our liberty and separate nationality, away with it!" Officers of the Confederate Army of Tennessee formally discussed the concept as early as January 1864, and the idea spread as the year progressed. Confederate proponents of black enlistment and emancipation warned that defeat would bring radical abolition and its untold horrors, while partial emancipation after a Confederate victory would protect white supremacy and leave blacks working for their former masters. The very idea still horrified most Confederates. The Richmond Whig called freeing slave soldiers "a repudiation of the opinion held by the whole South that . . . that servitude is a divinely appointed condition for the highest good of the slave." "If slaves will make good soldiers," Georgia senator Howell Cobb agreed, "our whole theory of slavery is wrong." "Victory itself would be robbed of its glory if shared with slaves," wailed a Mississippi congressman. "If such a terrible calamity is to befall us," a Virginia newspaper concluded, "we infinitely prefer that Lincoln shall be the instrument of our disaster and degradation, than that we ourselves should strike the cowardly and suicidal blow." Staring at defeat, however, senior leaders reluctantly disagreed. In February 1865, two months before his final surrender, General Robert E. Lee endorsed black enlistment and advised, "It would be neither just nor wise . . . to require them to serve as slaves." President Davis endorsed the idea to his cabinet, and a close vote in the Confederate Congress authorized him to obtain black soldiers from the states, without specifying if freedom would be their reward. Two black companies formed in Richmond, but the war ended before they saw combat. The end came faster than Richmond debaters could imagine. Grant had spent the winter of 1864–1865 inching slowly around Petersburg, trying to block Lee’s access to railroads and prevent him from joining Johnston in the Carolinas. Lee’s troops had grown thinner and more exhausted, finally leading thousands of once stalwart but now disheartened warriors to make peace privately by a quiet departure for home. By April 2, with desertions mounting and Grant growing stronger, Lee could hold the city no longer and notified Davis he intended to retreat. Still hoping to survive, perhaps in Mexico as a government-in-exile, Davis and his senior officials boarded trains as the army limped westward. --- It was not enough. Pursuers trapped the remnants of the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865. To formalize surrender, the two generals met in the parlor of a local home, Lee in his finest dress uniform, Grant in his fatigues and muddy boots. Refusing Lee’s sword, Grant gave generous terms to his adversary. Pending a final settlement, surrendering Confederates could simply stack their weapons and go home. Soldiers could also keep their own horses and mules for spring plowing, and officers retained their side arms. Eight days later, Johnston surrendered to Sherman near the modern city of Durham, North Carolina. Union troops captured Davis and Vice President Stephens soon afterward and resistance sputtered out across the South. On June 19, 1865, the last federal troops reached Texas and liberated the slaves of Galveston, an event still celebrated as Juneteenth. The war for the Union was finally over. After winning reelection in November, Lincoln had taken the oath of office on March 4, 1865, with a haunting second inaugural address. Passing over northern victories with scarcely a comment, he reminded America that its sufferings had come from slavery and suggested that its sins had incurred divine punishment. Lincoln prayed for the killing to stop. “Yet, if God wills that it continue,” he went on, “until all the wealth piled by the bondsman’s two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said ‘the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.’” Though he gave sacred significance to Union victory, Lincoln would not gloat. “With malice toward none,” he concluded, “with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation’s wounds, . . . to do all which may achieve . . . a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.” While he called for charity, Lincoln’s invocation of divine support showed his enduring commitment to the war’s goals. Shortly before his death, he also showed how his view of those goals had changed as his racial views evolved. Lincoln had once denied blacks’ equality and the government’s right to free them. From there he moved to supporting emancipation with colonization. In his last public address, Lincoln ignored colonization but acknowledged that black men deserved more than just freedom. Speaking of the right to vote, he said, “I would myself prefer that it were now conferred on the very intelligent, and on those who serve our cause as soldiers.” Hearing Lincoln’s support for limited black suffrage, actor and --- southern sympathizer John Wilkes Booth vowed to stop him and organized a coordinated assault on the Union’s senior leadership. Secretary of War Edwin Stanton fought off his assailant, Secretary of State William H. Seward survived a stabbing, and Vice President Johnson’s attacker apparently lost his nerve, but Booth’s bullet found Lincoln in Ford’s Theater on the night of April 14, 1865. By early next morning, Abraham Lincoln lay dead. * The Civil War erupted from a conflict over slavery’s place in the republic. The Republican Party viewed slavery as blighting opportunity for white men. Seeing the western territories as essential places for overcrowded easterners to flourish, Republicans hoped openly for slavery’s collapse and vowed to protect white equality by excluding slavery from the West. Southerners replied that the exclusion of slavery made slaveholders unequal citizens and deprived them of equally needed room for expansion. If Republicans gained the presidency, vowed sectional extremists, the South must leave the Union to avoid the danger and disgrace of inequality. Slavery itself became a casualty of the war. Runaways like John Boston confronted the North with slavery’s contradictions by fleeing to Union lines and working for Union victory. In doing so, they taught the North the importance of African Americans for the victory of one side or the other and the impossibility of returning the contrabands to bondage. Hating slavery but baffled over how to end it, Lincoln embraced emancipation as a military necessity. Emancipation transformed the Union that the North had fought to preserve. Once a slaveholders’ republic, the United States became legally committed to equality, an achievement that later failures could not erase. The nation’s new citizens made new demands on its public sphere and forced the government to exercise new powers in its halting efforts to meet them. Reconstruction would not succeed in the short run, but it established the constitutional basis for further struggle in later generations. --- # CHAPTER 15 ## Reconstructing the Republic, 1865–1877 Easter Sunday morning, April 13, 1873, was not a day of peace in the tiny hamlet of Colfax, the seat of government in Grant Parish, Louisiana. Two rival governments of Louisiana, one supported by ex-Confederate Democrats and the other by black Republicans and their white allies, had emerged from a racially charged election dispute. In Grant Parish, each set of claimants demanded the surrender of the other, and both sides were preparing to fight. Grant Parish lies in north-central Louisiana, between the Red River and Bayou Darro. In 1873, its black population lived on waterfront cotton and sugar plantations while most white families lived on smaller upland farms, leaving the parish almost evenly divided between white and black. The Red River country had a rough reputation for African American slaves, but conditions there had radically changed since the antebellum days. Freed by the Civil War, the black men of Grant could vote in 1873 and swore to defend their chosen government by force if necessary. As a New Orleans newspaper put it, “The years of freedom which they have enjoyed have had their effect on them, as well as the military education which many of them received in the United States Army. The time is past, if ever it existed, when a handful of whites could frighten a regiment of colored men.” When Republicans and Democrats both claimed victory in the state elections of 1872, black Republicans expelled white Democrats from the Colfax courthouse, but whites recruited their neighbors to fight back. “When that Tytantic Black Hand was sweeping over the Red River Valley in 1873 we Catahoula Parish boys—then known as the Old Time Ku Klux Klan—were called to the Test of White Supremacy and rescue of the town of Colfax,” one participant remembered much later. When sufficient forces arrived—variously estimated at 125–300 --- [The image shows a political cartoon depicting two armed men, one labeled "WHITE LEAGUE" and the other "K.K.K."

"I give you two hours to get your negro women and children and all the negroes who do not want to fight out of town," Nash demanded. "We are going to get 'em." Astride his handsome horse and flourishing an impressive sword, Allen remained defiant. "I'll see you when you get 'em," he shot back and galloped to his lines. The contenders traded --- rifle and cannon fire for two hours without effect until 30 white men slipped around the defenders and attacked from the rear. Caught in a cross fire, the black fighters fell back to the courthouse and kept shooting until the whites set its roof ablaze. Then the killing began in earnest. According to the recollections of white participants, fleeing blacks “were ridden down in the open fields and shot without mercy,” while bayonet thrusts dispatched the wounded. Fighting finally ceased around 4:00 p.m., and white leaders decided to hold the 40 or so black survivors for a later trial. But after most whites had gone home, a band of “young, reckless, and irresponsible men,” filled up with liquor, decided not to wait for courtroom justice. With gunshots crackling “like popcorn in a skillet,” they killed their prisoners on the spot. No one can be sure how many died in Colfax that day, but New Orleans police later buried over 60 bodies, and families buried others privately. The Colfax Massacre was the bloodiest single incident in the violence-torn years that followed the Civil War, the era of America’s Reconstruction. How was the Colfax Massacre possible? Why was the control of local government worth so much bloodshed? How, only ten years after the Emancipation Proclamation, had African American men won the power to carry arms and cast ballots? All these questions were central to the issues raised by the effort to reconstruct the Union after the Civil War. The struggle in Grant Parish was part of a much wider conflict between whites and blacks, southerners and northerners, Democrats and Republicans, over how to rebuild American society. Even before the Civil War began, Americans had used the word “reconstruction” to describe the process of bringing the seceding states back into the Union. They continued this legal usage at war’s end, but the end of slavery meant that full reconstruction would include social and economic transformation as well as political and constitutional reunification. As the battle in Colfax illustrated, social and political change blended, for participants could not implement their visions for a post-slave society without invoking local, state, and national governments. In the spring of 1877, conservative white southerners won a major political victory, as blacks lost support from northern white Republicans and the federal government abandoned formal efforts to remake the South. Despite the withdrawal of federal troops and the formal readmission of the seceding states, the society and economy of the South were still profoundly changed from the days of legalized slavery. Social, economic, and even political questions were not fully settled --- in 1877, and struggles continued until 1900 and beyond as Americans wrestled over the structure and traditions of their transformed republic for generations to come. ## Binding Up the Nation’s Wounds Putting the United States back together again was a monumental task. The seceding and border states suffered serious physical damage that needed repair. More profoundly, emancipation had overturned the South’s fundamental institution but left the practical meaning of freedom unclear. White northerners, white southerners, and the four million former slaves all differed over what should replace slavery. Black Americans’ role in the new national order became a deeply charged political issue with profound consequences for the postwar world. War and emancipation had also strained the nation’s constitutional fabric. If secession was illegal (as the North had always insisted), were the former Confederates guilty of treason? If so, how should they be punished? Or forgiven? Did the seceding states still have “states’ rights,” or were they more like conquered provinces? Who should determine the meaning of black freedom—white northerners, white southerners, or blacks themselves? And who should settle these questions—Congress or the president? Debates over these issues would lead to more violence and the first impeachment of a president of the United States. ### FREEDOM AND DESTRUCTION War’s end brought widespread rejoicing for the victors, mingled with grief and anger over the death of President Abraham Lincoln on April 15, 1865, just five days after the major Confederate surrender at Appomattox Court House in Virginia. As fighting sputtered out, Union generals Ulysses S. Grant and William T. Sherman brought their armies to Washington for a grand victory parade, and most of their soldiers soon left for their homes. A small number of Union troops, many of them black, remained behind to police the defeated South. Stretched very thin and kept under constant political pressure, they would be responsible for protecting the fragile experiment of Reconstruction. Returning Union veterans knew they were lucky to be alive. Just over 2.2 million men—about half of those eligible—had worn blue uniforms, but at least 360,000 had died in service, and 275,000 had suffered wounds. These casualties were an immense sacrifice by the --- standards of earlier and later wars. The 4,800 Americans who died in one day at the Battle of Antietam, for example, had exceeded the 4,000 battle deaths in the entire Revolutionary War. As many as 750,000 Americans perished in the Civil War, almost twice the number who died in World War II. Unlike their Confederate counterparts, former Union soldiers would receive generous federal pensions in the years ahead, though southern state governments would do what they could for their aging veterans. Historians once believed that the Civil War enriched the North, as large military expenditures stimulated the production of iron and steel and fostered the growth of a powerful industrial economy. In fact, these developments had begun before the war, and the destruction of lives and property probably did more to slow economic growth than hasten it. After a sharp recession caused by the cancellation of military contracts, growth resumed by the beginning of 1868 as railroad construction boomed, cities expanded, European immigration continued to expand, and settlers flocked to the Great Plains. In the decades to come, northern workers would feel the sting of poverty and deprivation as their employers struggled to keep costs down and profits up, and protests would reverberate through northern society, but most northern Americans would escape the grinding want that afflicted many black and white southerners. In politics, northern voters split unevenly between a Republican majority and a Democratic minority. The Republicans had formed in 1854 to oppose the Kansas-Nebraska Act and the spread of slavery to the territories, and their victory in the presidential election of 1860 had sparked southern secession. Strongly appealing to Union veterans and native-born, middle-class whites, Republicans had fervently supported the war for the Union and wanted to protect what their sacrifices had achieved. Especially in Congress, a small but determined group of Radical Republicans pressed for strong antislavery measures in wartime and active aid to the newly freed thereafter. Moderate Republicans preferred to move more gradually but often became more radical when white southerners resisted even limited change. Like their southern counterparts, northern Democrats praised white men’s equality, states’ rights, and a weak federal government. Many had southern sympathies and strongly objected to emancipation and racial equality as wartime goals. Their party was popular among foreign-born urban workers and native-born Americans—often midwesterners with southern roots—from isolated or underdeveloped rural districts. The war’s political legacy gave a strongly partisan cast --- to Reconstruction policies. Especially among Republicans, the war’s goals had changed over time. At first, most northerners had fought to restore “the Union as it was.” As the war continued, many realized that they could not restore the old Union and had to establish a new one without slavery, the cause of the Union’s rupture. Even before the war, slavery had shaped rival visions for America, and northerners now expected their own vision to prevail. Without entirely realizing it, they wanted southerners to concede a moral as well as a military victory, to surrender their principles along with their guns and admit they had been wrong. To do so, northerners wanted southerners to renounce slavery completely, reject their secessionist leaders, embrace surviving unionists, and treat their ex-slaves fairly. Few ex-Confederates could willingly pass this test of loyalty. Defeated Confederates faced a far different future from their Union counterparts, and despair gripped many. “We have nothing on earth to look forward to,” mourned
