between us and Old England. You Indi --- ans are not concerned in it." With longstanding ties to Britain, most Iroquois thought otherwise. Thayendanegea, a talented Mohawk chief and Anglican convert whom the English called Joseph Brant, had been educated among whites, visited Britain, and served as a British interpreter. His sister Molly Brant joined him in building ties between the British and the Iroquois. Joseph Brant led Indian fighters in damaging raids on western New York and Pennsylvania in 1779, but had no more lasting success than the Cherokees. In 1779, an American punitive expedition destroyed 40 Iroquois towns while their inhabitants sought shelter with the British at Fort Niagara. Shawnee and Delaware warriors likewise fought with the British in the Ohio country. Kentucky militia under General George Rogers Clark captured British posts in the future Illinois, but white Americans did not control most of the Trans-Appalachian West when fighting finally ended. Indians thus expected the British to protect their land claims in peace negotiations. That moment was still distant when France declared war in 1778, but French and Spanish participation had major implications for the military struggle. War with France required the British to keep forces at home to prevent a cross-Channel invasion, leading some strategists to worry that British power was spread too thin to prevail. King George would not hear of defeat, however, so strategy changed again. Stalemated in the North, Britain fought in the South instead. ## WAR IN THE SOUTH British planners believed that southern Loyalists only waited for a chance to rally to the king. They also knew that southern slaves were potential allies who terrified their rebellious masters. General Clinton tested the potential of a southern campaign by sending a small force to Georgia in November 1778. They quickly captured Savannah and then the rest of Georgia, reestablishing a loyal legislature and the semblance of colonial rule. A year later, Clinton followed up with an attack on South Carolina. Sailing from New York, his expedition captured Charleston in May 1780 and fanned out across South Carolina. Clinton then returned to New York, leaving General Lord Charles Cornwallis in charge. The new commander scored a crucial victory at the Battle of Camden on August 16, 1780, when he smashed the American army of General Horatio Gates. Gates had been the hero of Saratoga three years earlier, but he and his men collapsed at Camden, running pell-mell from the British charge and apparently opening the South to full-scale occupation. --- Cornwallis did find Loyalists in South Carolina. The state had embraced independence reluctantly in 1776, and some leaders still favored a cooperative or coordinate linkage with Britain. Severe class and sectional divisions split the whites and led some to side with Britain simply because their enemies supported the Continental Congress. Even some prominent Whigs concluded that British victory was inevitable, and either pledged allegiance to the Crown or accepted Clinton’s invitation to lay down their arms without reprisals. Cornwallis mustered sympathizers into Loyalist militias, but soon found their loyalty unreliable and their power to reestablish order even weaker. Wherever Loyalist units emerged, Whig militias formed nearby, and the two sides began robbing and butchering one another. British officers tended to treat all Americans as the enemy and plundered the property of Whigs and Loyalists alike, driving their victims to the Whig camp. Cornwallis decided that Clinton had been too lenient, and decreed that all defeated Whigs must not only stop fighting but give him active support, a decision that turned many sidelined Whigs against him. Militia units switched sides, sometimes more than once, and both armies faced gangs of bandits who killed and looted indiscriminately. Social disruption badly undermined the occupation of South Carolina. Whig guerillas erupted everywhere behind Cornwallis’s lines, attacking supply trains and isolated soldiers. British and Tory forces tried to intimidate their enemies with unsparing violence against prisoners, civilians, and private property, and Whigs retaliated in kind. At King’s Mountain, for example, in October 1780, a party of “overmountain” men from what later became Tennessee surrounded and defeated a Loyalist force on the border of North and South Carolina but slaughtered many of their prisoners. “Such scenes of desolation, bloodshed and deliberate murder I never was a witness to before . . . !” exclaimed one Continental officer. “For want of civil government the bands of society are totally disunited, and the people, by copying the manners of the British, have become perfectly savage.” ### THE AFRICAN AMERICANS’ WAR African Americans recognized the War for Independence as an opportunity to find their own freedom, and weighed their options carefully. Like Solomon, the son of Venture Smith of Connecticut, a certain number of northern blacks fought for American independence, including about 150 free men of color at the Battle of Bunker Hill and --- eventually as many as 500 from Massachusetts alone. George Washington initially accepted blacks in the Continental Army but expelled them when white southerners objected. He slightly relented six weeks later, still closing his ranks to slaves but accepting free men of color. In 1777 and 1778, as many as one-fourth of Rhode Island’s enslaved men of military age joined an almost all-black regiment when offered freedom at war’s end, and fought successfully all the way to Yorktown. Far more African Americans served the British. As early as 1774, Abigail Adams reported to her husband, John, that a number of enslaved Bostonians had conspired to fight for Governor Gage in exchange for arms and the promise of freedom. Lord Dunmore began to gather his Ethiopian Regiment a year later, and the scale of black support for the British soared when the war moved south in 1779. British strategists had long seen slaves and Indians as potential allies who could attack the revolution from within. In January of 1775, the House of Commons had discussed emancipation as a means of “humbling the high aristocratic spirit of Virginia and the southern colonies,” but the proposal only seems to have stiffened colonial resistance. When South Carolina’s provincial congress heard the news that May, it added “the dread of instigated insurrections at home” to the news from Lexington and Concord as grounds “to drive an oppressed people to the use of arms.” North Carolinians quickly echoed them and dispatched patrols “for the more effectually disarming and keeping the negroes in order.” Jefferson likewise mentioned the alleged incitement of “merciless Indian Savages” as one of the causes that justified the Declaration of Independence. Even as they recognized the potential uses of black allies, British leaders did not want to alienate slaveholding neutrals or Loyalists, much less to start a race war. A general assault on southern slavery was therefore unlikely, even if the British had favored it in principle. To encourage desertions, they decided to free the slaves who fled to them from rebel owners but to keep captured slaves as booty. The slaves of Loyalists would remain with their masters. Clear in theory, these distinctions proved difficult to maintain in practice. Slave escapes subsided after Dunmore’s defeat and withdrawal, but immediately began again with the invasion of Georgia in 1778. Throughout the South, both Whigs and Loyalists took thousands of slaves from their enemies, along with livestock, wagons, and food supplies. In the confusion, some black Georgians headed for British-held Florida, where Spain had sheltered runaways in the past. Others --- built maroon communities in swamps or forests, but more joined the British forces. Women and children joined the exodus, though in smaller numbers than men. So many escaped that commanders could not use them all, but many worked as laborers or servants, and some served in pioneer units building roads, bridges, and fortifications. Of Georgia’s 15,000 slaves, as many as 5,000 escaped in the first three months of the invasion, joined by 5,000 more by war’s end. Escapes only multiplied when Cornwallis entered the Carolinas and Virginia. Well-versed in the paths and waterways of the lowcountry, black guides steered his troops to Charleston, and then up the main rivers into the piedmont. Desperate to avoid capture and to keep their human property, Whig planters scattered before the enemy and brought as many slaves as possible along with them. As in Georgia, those left behind could seek their freedom in Florida, in the woods, or with the invaders. A few fought in British uniforms. Anxious to preserve social order, British commanders put captured slaves to work on confiscated plantations, gave some to Loyalists to cover their losses, and sold some as personal property. Fighting back, Whig commanders assembled militia units by promising captured slaves as soldiers’ pay or as enlistment bounties. Tragically, however, disease still raged in British ranks. Fugitive blacks got the worst food, clothing, and shelter available, so pestilence took thousands who had just grasped their liberty. Across the entire South, perhaps as many as 80,000–100,000 enslaved African Americans left their masters in the American Revolution, but only about 20,000 departed with the British in 1782. Of these, perhaps half found freedom in Canada or Africa and half faced re-enslavement in Florida or the West Indies. Faced with lashings, death, or sale if recaptured, a probable majority of southern slaves decided to remain in place, but the war had badly disrupted the institution of bondage. ### VICTORY AND THE TREATY OF PARIS Realizing that guerillas alone could not stop Cornwallis, Washington sent his ablest subordinate, General Nathanael Greene, to reconstitute the Continental Army in the South. Greene reached North Carolina in November 1780 and began to reassemble the army’s fragments. By a series of bold maneuvers, he and his deputies drew Cornwallis out of South Carolina and into a wild goose chase across the interior of North Carolina, into Virginia, and back again. He paused for battle --- at Guilford Courthouse, North Carolina, in March 1781, and inflicted heavy casualties before another retreat. Cornwallis did not pursue him but marched his bloodied and exhausted troops to the North Carolina coast and pondered what to do. His withdrawal from Georgia and the Carolinas had ceded all the British gains of the past 15 months, leaving them with no more than a few southern ports. To complete this achievement, Greene turned away from Cornwallis to mop up remaining resistance in South Carolina. Cornwallis rested briefly in the coastal town of Wilmington and then headed north. Hoping for a fresh start, he looked for a spot beside the Chesapeake where supplies could reach him by sea. In August 1781, he settled on the village of Yorktown, located on a peninsula formed by the York and James Rivers. It was a fatal mistake. The French fleet sailed from the West Indies and closed the entrance to Chesapeake Bay. Washington slipped away from Clinton in New York, and sped his army south. With a French force under General Rochambeau, the allies sealed the neck of the York Peninsula in September 1781 and began bombarding the British camp. Hopelessly surrounded, Cornwallis accepted defeat within a month and surrendered his entire army of 7,000 men on October 19, 1781. Yorktown did not end all fighting, for there were still strong British armies in New York, Charleston, Savannah, and elsewhere in North America, but Parliament had no more stomach for the contest. Lord North resigned and King George replaced him with the Marquess of Rockingham, who had managed repeal of the Stamp Act. Rockingham agreed to peace, and the Continental Congress sent Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and John Jay to Paris, where they slowly hammered out a settlement with their British counterparts. On November 30, 1782, over a year after Yorktown, the negotiators signed a preliminary agreement in which Britain recognized American independence and set the new nation’s boundaries at the Canadian border, the Mississippi River, and the 31st parallel, north of Florida. Both sides promised to honor their prewar debts to the other, and the United States made an empty promise to request the state legislatures to return the confiscated property of Loyalists. Violating a promise to the northwestern tribes, Britain did not require Americans to recognize Indian claims in the Ohio country. “It was an act of cruelty and injustice that Christians *only* were capable of doing,” tribal spokesmen protested, who now faced expansionist Americans with only token support from British Canada and Spanish Florida. --- It took another year for France and Spain to work out their own differences with Britain, including the return of Florida to Spain, so the final treaty was not signed until September 3, 1783. When British vessels finally sailed from New York, Charleston, and Savannah, they carried over 30,000 white Loyalists and as many as 20,000 African Americans to new homes in Florida, Canada, Nova Scotia, and Sierra Leone, a British African colony for free blacks. * The American War for Independence had finally ended. Jubilant citizens celebrated with toasts, bonfires, parades, and public speeches. The war had cost thousands of lives: 6,824 American fighters fell in battle, diseases took another 10,000, and 8,500 died while prisoners of war. British losses were about the same, but the toll among escaped and captured slaves was far higher. Economic historians estimate that the United States spent as much as $400 million just to pay its troops, while Britain’s costs may have reached £250 million. France and Spain also spent vast sums, and the costs of boycotts, property damage, and lost opportunities were proportionately high. To cover its costs, the United States had borrowed heavily from foreign governments and its own citizens; these creditors would now demand repayment from a struggling economy, while consumers borrowed more to regain what they had lost. The state and federal governments had also issued millions of dollars and pounds in paper money, which had largely lost its value, giving the new nation little hard currency with which to rebuild. At war’s end, George Washington made a widely praised gesture of self-restraint by relinquishing power and resigning his commission. As he did so, citizens asked themselves anxiously if other Americans would always act so virtuously, especially in economic matters. No one had planned for independence when colonial protests had begun, for the British had no desire to “enslave” the Americans and Americans felt genuine loyalty to Britain. Americans were deeply fearful of plots against their liberty, however, and after 1763, British steps to consolidate the empire seemed to follow a well-rehearsed script for the approach of despotism. Even if the colonists’ fears were overblown, the centralization that British leaders wanted was incompatible with the degree of liberty and self-government that the colonists thought they deserved. The American gentry expected to govern their homelands, but Parliament wanted “to bind them in all cases whatsoever.” These sets of expectations were fundamentally irreconcilable. --- The American gentry did not win independence by themselves. The "better sort" had sought support from ordinary free Americans, and they had responded, both for the sake of their interests and their liberties. The war ended in 1783, but the revolution did not, for these Americans would demand a place in the republic that replaced British rule. --- # CHAPTER 6 ## A Federal Republic, 1783–1789 The evening of St. Patrick’s Day 1784 was raucous in Charleston, South Carolina, especially in the tavern of Captain William Thompson, veteran of the recently concluded War of Independence. The local Society of the Sons of St. Patrick had assembled for its annual banquet, and news of the final peace treaty with Great Britain had just arrived. Cannons boomed in the harbor, revelers filled the streets, and American and Irish patriots crowded the tavern to toast the triumph of liberty and equality over British tyranny. Unfortunately for Captain Thompson, the evening celebration touched off a quarrel with John Rutledge, former governor of South Carolina, current member of its legislature, future United States chief justice, and one of the low country’s wealthiest and most powerful gentlemen. Rutledge was invited to the banquet but stayed home, sending a female slave with the excuse that he was ill. Upon returning, the messenger complained that William Thompson had ignored her. When her angry master demanded an explanation the next day, tempers flared, insults flew, and the feisty tavern keeper wound up in Charleston’s jail, threatened with banishment for insulting the mighty John Rutledge and, through him, the dignity of the legislature itself. Uncowed, William Thompson poured out his rage in a local newspaper. Sarcastically he claimed that the incident proved that “a *wretch* of no higher rank in the commonwealth than of Common-Citizen” could be attacked and humiliated by “those *self-exalted* characters, who affect to compose the *grand hierarchy* of the State . . . for having dared to dispute with a *John Rutledge*, or any of the *NABOB tribe*.” According to Thompson, men like Rutledge were unfit for public leadership, for “their pride, influence, ambition, connections, wealth and political principles” were “calculated to subvert *Republicanism.*” --- QUEBEC (GREAT BRITAIN) ---- LOUISIANA (SPAIN) ---- THE UNITED STATES IN 1783 (WITH FUTURE STATE BOUNDARIES) | U.S. States: | (shaded areas on map) | |----------------------------|-----------------------| | Western Land Claims: | (dotted areas on map) | | States' territorial claims | are in brackets: [VA] | | Indian territorial claims | are underlined: CREEK | ---- MAP 3.

In the years of pre-Revolutionary protest, white merchants and artisans had joined together in the Sons of Liberty. During the recent war, Governor John Rutledge had taken a hard line against Loyalists and British merchants. When peace returned, however, he and his equally powerful brothers Edward and Hugh wished to restore normal commerce. To promote the orderly sale and export of plantation products, they pressured the legislature to halt confiscations and allow British merchants to collect their debts and stay in business. Merchants and planters supported these measures, but the town’s white artisans and shopkeepers opposed them bitterly, fearing that a wave of cheap British imports would rob them of the fruits of liberty. The Marine Anti-Britannic Society began protest meetings at William Thompson’s City Tavern, infuriating gentlemen like the Rutledges who believed that their social inferiors had no understanding of the issues and no business challenging their wisdom. For them, the Revolution had unleashed an audacious and even dangerous challenge to civil order and gentry power. Determined to nip such insolence in the bud, John Rutledge surely welcomed the opportunity to silence his upstart critic with jail and banishment. In the short term, Rutledge won out. The Marine Anti-Britannic Society defended Thompson “for his *spirited, manly,* and *patriotic* conduct . . . , when *Aristocratical principles* endeavored to subvert and destroy every *genuine idea* of real *republicanism,*” but the planters proved more powerful. William Thompson was not legally banished, but he lost the gentry’s business and then his lease. By 1785, he had disappeared from Charleston. The Rutledge-Thompson quarrel raised crucial questions for republican society and government. How much “natural” inequality was tolerable in an egalitarian republic? How could the rights of ordinary men withstand the power of entrenched privilege? From the perspective of men like John Rutledge, the property rights of British merchants, the treaty obligations of the United States, and the orderly flow of international trade were all at risk from the ignorant and impertinent brawling of men like William Thompson and the Marine Anti-Britannic Society. If turbulent war and giddy rhetoric had distracted such men from a proper sense of subordination to their betters, they had to be taught a lesson both personally and politically. A private quarrel thus became a public controversy. Three years later, in
