Federalist Papers*. --- Two of America’s first professional authors, the New Yorkers Washington Irving and James Fenimore Cooper, fed romantic nationalism by celebrating the distinctive qualities of America’s people and landscape. Irving became popular for his folklore-inspired tales of the Hudson Valley, including “Rip Van Winkle” and “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.” Cooper created an immortal frontier hero, Natty Bumpo, and followed his adventures through five novels, including *The Deerslayer* and *The Last of the Mohicans*. A noble hunter who drew his strength of character from his roots in nature, Bumpo prefigured Daniel Boone and Davy Crockett as a prototype for countless western heroes, from fictional frontiersmen to film stars such as John Wayne and Clint Eastwood. Romanticism also appeared in the work of a small corps of professional American painters. Beginning in the 1820s, Thomas Cole broke free from the portraits and historical subjects of eighteenth-century artists with sweeping landscapes that evoked the nation’s seemingly endless possibilities. Asher Durand and Frederic Edwin Church, Cole’s followers in the so-called Hudson River School, continued to paint inspiring landscapes like the Catskill Mountains and Niagara Falls, hoping that vast scenes of natural beauty could elevate humanity to the spiritual greatness that romantics called the “sublime.” Conscious of the moral perils hidden in America’s vast environment, Cole also used landscape series like *The Course of Empire* and *The Voyage of Life* to warn viewers against the dangers of national or personal complacency. Less grandiose, the likeable people in George Caleb Bingham’s paintings of specific locales seemed to demonstrate the benefits of political democracy and the proper balance between wilderness and civilization. ### TRANSCENDENTALISM Romantic inspiration brought an influential group of New England intellectuals to a new philosophical movement they called Transcendentalism. Early in the nineteenth century, a few New England ministers had reacted against evangelical emotionalism by exploring what they saw as a more reasonable and benevolent approach to Christianity. Becoming known as Unitarians, they continued traditional worship but stressed God’s love, compassion, and rationality over belief in miracles or the divinity of Christ. By the mid-1830s, a few daring intellectuals around Boston had pushed beyond Unitarianism and --- gathered to discuss Hindu scriptures, Chinese philosophy, and German free thought in a circle they called the Transcendental Club. The most prominent Transcendentalist was Ralph Waldo Emerson, a former Unitarian minister who forged a new career as an essayist and popular lecturer. Others included George Ripley, founder of the utopian community at Brook Farm; Margaret Fuller, editor of the groups’ journal, the *Dial*; and Henry David Thoreau, a seeming ne’er-do-well who composed enduring classics in American environmental and political thought. The Transcendentalists’ teachings remained rather hazy, but they all believed that close contact with nature, a reliance on unfettered genius, and openness to insights from all sources could reveal truths that transcended the materialism and religious dogmatism they found elsewhere in America. Americans knew Emerson best for his manifestos of individualism. If all men and every generation were truly equal, he demanded, “why should not we also enjoy an original relation to the universe?” His 1837 address “The American Scholar” proclaimed that “we have listened too long to the courtly verses of Europe,” and insisted that American intellectuals should be engaged and innovative creators, not the guardians of dead facts. In his 1841 essay “Self-Reliance,” Emerson told readers to find truth within themselves, not in tradition or society. “To believe your own thought, to believe what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men, — that is genius,” he insisted. “Whoso would be a man, must be a nonconformist.” Emerson shocked Americans by dismissing politics and conventional Christianity, but they loved his confidence in their own inner capacities. In later generations, many Americans would share the Transcendentalists’ conviction that personal enlightenment could supersede churchly doctrines, and followed this faith into diverse forms of self-help and alternative spirituality. Between 1840 and 1844, Transcendentalist critic and editor Margaret Fuller wrote her most important book, *Woman in the Nineteenth Century*. In it, she called for equal spiritual growth for men and women, inside and outside the bonds of marriage. Fuller next became a regular columnist for Horace Greeley’s prominent newspaper, the *New York Tribune*, where she vigorously called for female equality, including equal education, suffrage, and employment. She likewise championed the rights of slaves, Indians, prisoners, and the poor, and won praise as a major pioneer in feminist thought. Henry David Thoreau practiced his friend Emerson’s individualist --- convictions by his simple manner of living, his travels in the American wilderness, and his moving descriptions of natural beauty. Observing the frantic search for wealth among ordinary Americans, Thoreau concluded that "the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation," and took to the woods to find an alternative. After living for two years in a small cabin beside Walden Pond, near Concord, Massachusetts, he hymned the results in his classic account *Walden*, published in 1854. Thoreau also questioned relationships between individuals and the state that other Americans took for granted. In his 1849 essay "Resistance to Civil Government," later republished as "Civil Disobedience," Thoreau discounted majority rule because majorities were so often wrong. "Must the citizen ever for a moment, or in the least degree, resign his conscience to the legislator?" he asked. "Why has every man a conscience, then?" Thoreau's conscience told him that the United States and Massachusetts were both deeply wrong in tolerating the sin of slavery and conducting an unjust war on Mexico. Unwilling to go along, he drew a night in jail when he refused to pay his taxes in protest. "I think that we should be men first, and subjects afterward," he explained. "It is not desirable to cultivate a respect for the law, so much as for the right." The principle of civil disobedience had little impact in Thoreau's lifetime, but it became central to political protest in the twentieth century. Citing Thoreau, advocates for an independent India, civil rights for African Americans, and democracy in South Africa all protested oppression by peacefully violating unjust laws to expose the injustice of the governments that imposed them. Thoreau's visit to the Concord jail had long repercussions. ### DARKER VOICES Not all participants in the American Renaissance shared Emerson's sunny optimism. Novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne doubted that America could easily shrug off the weight of its past, and brooded on the problem of recalcitrant evil in human life. In numerous short stories and in novels like *The Scarlet Letter* and *The House of Seven Gables*, his characters struggled to escape the repressive influence of Puritanism and its legacy of hypocrisy, guilt, and self-recrimination. The poems and short stories of Edgar Allan Poe intensified the dark tone of Hawthorne's fiction in their treatment of lost love, murder, remorse, and death. Poe's and Hawthorne's contemporary Herman Melville first won fame with --- idyllic stories of an American sailor in the South Seas, but revealed a much darker side in *Moby Dick*, the story of a vengeful sea captain consumed by his search for a white whale. Published in 1851, this complex novel explored the dark side of individualism, and suggested that obsessive pursuit of a personal vision might destroy men instead of freeing them. This pessimistic theme attracted few readers in the 1850s, and Melville’s later work did not receive praise or careful study until the twentieth century. Poet Emily Dickinson also dwelt on life’s tragedies as she looked inward on the female experience. Perhaps disappointed in love, certainly preoccupied with mortality and immortality, Dickinson secluded herself in the 1850s in her family home in Amherst, Massachusetts, where she poured her wry and sometimes anguished feelings into brief, eloquent poems hidden in her notebooks. Mostly unpublished before her death in 1886, Dickinson’s deeply private voice remained mostly unheard until the twentieth century. ### DEMOCRACY’S ADVOCATES New England was not the only literary locale in antebellum America, and neither Transcendentalism nor dark reflections engaged all authors. A group of native and adopted New York writers called themselves “Young America” and clustered around Democratic Party editor John L. O’Sullivan and his literary and political journal the *United States Magazine and Democratic Review*, published from 1837 to 1859. Modeled after contemporary nationalist movements in Europe, Young America shared Emerson’s desire for a distinctive American literature, but loudly asserted its devotion to American superiority, democratic equality, majority rule, and geographical expansion. Some members questioned slavery; others took little interest in it. Novelists Nathaniel Hawthorne and Herman Melville, critic Evert A. Duykinck, and poets John Greenleaf Whittier, William Cullen Bryant, and Walt Whitman all played active roles in the *Democratic Review*, Young America, or both. Even when the Democratic Party seemed to lose much of its energy and optimism in the 1850s, the Young America group continued to demand a revitalized commitment to their own views of progress and democratic principles. New York journalist Walt Whitman was probably the most original member of the Young America circle. In *Leaves of Grass*, published in 1855, Whitman used free verse to celebrate democratic equality and --- open and sensitive consciousness as keys to a higher human freedom. Bravely admitting the role of physical sensations and even sexuality in opening people to spiritual insights, Whitman referenced his own homosexual desires in language that contemporaries often overlooked but later generations found unmistakable. Excluded from Young America, a courageous cadre of black writers demanded to join its celebrated democracy, most obviously through autobiographical narratives of their escapes from slavery. Maryland runaway Frederick Douglass published his enduring classic *Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass* in 1845 before he became a leader of the abolitionist movement. In it, he showed how he struggled physically and mentally to claim the freedom and independence that America offered its white men. When he did emerge as a major abolitionist speaker, Douglass used his eloquence to excoriate the moral blindness of a nation that boasted of democracy while enslaving one-sixth of its people. In his scathing oration “What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?,” originally delivered as an Independence Day address, Douglass answered the question of its title with what he called “scorching irony.” To the slave, he cried to his listeners, “your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciations of tyrants, brass fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery.” Despite his scorn, Douglass did not denounce the principles of the Declaration of Independence. Instead, he invoked liberty, equality, and natural rights to expose white America’s hypocrisy and to demand their extension to everyone. Harriet Jacobs’s *Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl* portrayed the very different struggle of an enslaved woman, first to protect herself from sexual abuse, and then to preserve her children from sale. Now widely regarded as an outstanding account of the female slave experience, Jacobs’s work was largely forgotten after publication in 1861 and was misinterpreted until the end of the twentieth century. Harriet Beecher Stowe drew on the voluminous literature of slave narratives as written by escapees like Douglass and Jacobs to weave emotions and social protest together in *Uncle Tom’s Cabin*. Justly renowned for its host of vivid and engaging characters as well as its powerful sentimentality, Stowe’s best seller crystallized northern antislavery feeling and brought home the sufferings of slavery’s victims to white readers as no other work had yet done. --- # THE FREE LABOR IDEAL Writers and artists of the antebellum North drew many of their themes from the liberty, equality, and self-reliance that many white men valued in their daily lives. Even as late as 1860, most Americans still drew their livings from the soil and an estimated 57 percent of free farmers owned their own land. Most industries relied on small workshops with no more than 10 or 12 employees. Public spokesmen thus sang the praises of the independent property-owning citizen. Pennsylvania’s Thaddeus Stevens expressed the dominant idea precisely: “The middling classes who own the soil, and work it with their own hands are the main support of every free government.” As in politics, it was the struggle of the free average man to define and improve himself that provided the dominant drama of antebellum religion and reform. In reality, individual improvement eluded many Americans, even in the North’s environment of free labor. The ideal of the self-made man specifically excluded women, and the cult of true womanhood kept most middle-class women in their homes. Powerful racial prejudice likewise dismissed blacks, Indians, and Hispanic Americans as hopelessly incapable of true liberty. Factory workers faced industrial subordination, but many observers did not protest so long as most of those affected were young women like Lucy Larcom and Sarah Bagley, not men they regarded as worthy of true independence. Observers did worry about the future of freedom in a society dominated by wage labor. While antebellum workshops were still small by later standards, the Market Revolution undermined opportunities for independent artisans and kept growing numbers of adult men in the uncomfortable position of lifelong “hirelings,” sometimes called “wage slaves.” For the least fortunate urban workers, poverty and exploitation were already daily realities, and the “dark satanic mills” of Victorian England were grim reminders of what might be in store for growing numbers of Americans. These developments fostered labor unions and strikes, and brought gibes from the slave states that the liberty and equality of free society were delusions. Partly responding to these challenges and partly replying to the South, northern politicians and other popular spokesmen began to celebrate the ideal of “free labor.” “Free labor” could mean working for wages or self-employment, but orators saw no conflict between them, for they saw the first leading easily to the second. “A young man goes out to service — to labor, if you please to call it so,” explained Senator --- Zachariah Chandler of Michigan, working "for compensation until he acquires money enough to buy a farm . . . and soon he becomes himself the employer of labor." Abraham Lincoln had lived through the process and echoed the claim. "The man who labored for another last year," he declared in 1856, "this year labors for himself, and next year he will hire others to labor for him." In this view, the unlimited abundance of the American environment guaranteed that every hard-working freeman had the "right to rise," particularly in the boundless West. Cheap and fertile western land seemed to ensure that no one would be trapped in a servile condition, and the middling economic status that underpinned republican government would always be available to the deserving. Northern spokesmen also stressed that there was no serious class conflict in free society, for everybody was a worker, employers and employees alike. "Why who are the laboring people of the North?" inquired Daniel Webster in 1850. "They are the whole North. They are the people who till their own farms with their own hands; freeholders, educated men, independent men." No bloated aristocrats or degraded slaves existed to block opportunity for others, he implied, and so long as statesmen protected the ideal of free labor, the republic would be safe. Ironically, just as realistic hopes for self-employment were slipping out of reach for millions of Americans, free labor spokesmen like Webster blurred the differences between wage labor and business ownership by lauding paid employment as the gateway to the middle class. As sectional conflict intensified, northern leaders swore to protect the ideal of free labor, to preserve its promise as America expanded, and to protect it from slavery, its sinister opposite. * Since the days of the Puritans, visionary Americans had seen their "godly experiment" as an opportunity for the moral and spiritual elevation of humanity. "Wee shall be as a Citty upon a Hill," John Winthrop had prophesied. "The eyes of all people are upon us." Such aspirations gained a secular republican gloss with the coming of the Enlightenment and the success of the American Revolution, but did not lose their spiritual resonance. When Revolutionary fervor led to religious skepticism and political warfare, however, alarmed Americans struggled to restore what they saw as the nation's sacred mission. Their task grew more urgent as the Market Revolution unsettled --- communities from the cities to the frontier, unleashing problems like greed, violence, crime, drunkenness, unemployment, and poverty, and disrupting institutions like families, churches, schools, and public charity. From a cultural base in the New England heartland, idealistic reformers fanned across the North, drawing inspiration from religious revivals to build voluntary societies to cure the nation’s ills. Their movement often relied on the efforts of middle-class women and inspired some to challenge the restrictive bonds of domesticity. Among ordinary families and sophisticated intellectuals, the reformers stimulated a middle-class American culture based on evangelical religion, individual striving, personal virtue, and self-control. The reform movements had considerable success. Drinking declined, literacy increased, and churches multiplied. Early feminists met ridicule but their ideas took root and slowly gained strength. In the greatest change of all, northern opinion turned against slavery. If immediate abolition still frightened most whites, more and more believed that slavery undermined their own liberties as well as those of blacks, and that a republic based on free labor could not coexist forever with bondage. Hoping for slavery’s ultimate demise, northerners increasingly believed that the system should at least stop expanding. That conviction put them into growing conflict with white southerners, a conflict based on rival visions of the ideal American republic. --- HORRID MASSACRE IN VIRGINIA [The image shows a historical illustration divided into two main sections: - The upper section depicts a violent scene with several figures: 1.

Renowned in the neighborhood as a “Negro-breaker,” Covey rented spirited young slaves like Bailey for unusually low prices by promising to break their resistance to enslavement. > “If at any one time of my life more than another, I was made to drink the bitterest dregs of slavery, that time was during the first six months of my stay with Mr. Covey,” Bailey later remembered. He received his first whipping within a week of his arrival and about once a week thereafter. Work was incessant and there was never enough time to eat or rest. Under this treatment, Bailey felt completely crushed. “I was broken in body, soul, and spirit,” he later admitted. “The dark night of slavery closed in upon me,” and he became “a man transformed into a brute!” But Frederick Bailey’s destruction was not complete, for sparks of his independence and ambition still flickered. In the middle of August 1834, he collapsed from heat and exhaustion and could not resume work despite serious beating. Briefly escaping, Bailey sought help from his owner and a friendly older slave before summoning the strength to return to Covey. “You have seen how a man was made a slave,” Bailey later told friendly audiences; “you shall see how a slave was made a man.” This time, when Covey attempted to punish him, Bailey refused to submit. “From whence the spirit came I don’t know—I resolved to fight; and ... I seized Covey hard by the throat,” he later remembered. For two hours, the older man and the powerful teenager rolled and struggled across the barn floor. Finally the “Negro-breaker” was broken himself. Covey gave up the struggle and never whipped Bailey again. For the victorious young man, moreover, the battle with Edward --- Covey became "the turning point in my career as a slave." The fight "revived within me a sense of my own manhood. . . . It was a glorious resurrection, from the tomb of slavery, to the heaven of freedom." Bailey soon resolved to escape from slavery completely. Four years later, he disguised himself as a sailor and used forged free papers to slip from Maryland to Massachusetts. Frederick Bailey’s adventures did not end there. Taking the name of a popular fictional hero, he became "Frederick
