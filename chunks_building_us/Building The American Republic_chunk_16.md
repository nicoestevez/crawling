1765. “Thus by a [spread] of the most ridiculous Mimickry, the Fashions of London are communicated to the poorest, meanest town in Connecticut.” Moralists protested the love of luxury, but ordinary free Americans joined the gentry in using consumer imports to brighten their lives and display their achievements. ### REASON AND THE ENLIGHTENMENT As colonial society grew more elaborate, a transatlantic movement later called the Enlightenment reached growing numbers of educated Americans. Its ideas had begun to stir as early as 1637, when French philosopher René Descartes made his famous declaration, “I think, therefore I am,” and shifted the source of moral and intellectual authority from God and tradition to the rational human mind. Fifty years later, English scientist Sir Isaac Newton offered a practical demonstration of reason’s power in his *Principia Mathematica*, showing how natural laws, expressed in a few simple formulas, could explain the behavior of all moving objects, from a falling apple to revolving planets. The political and educational ideas of Englishman John Locke extended --- rationalist principles to human life, and promoted the perfectibility of human nature, the importance of individual rights and judgment, and the rights of subjects to overthrow oppressive rulers. By the middle of the eighteenth century, French scholars Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d’Alembert felt ready to catalogue all human knowledge in their comprehensive, 30-volume *Encyclopédie*. The French philosopher Voltaire applied his witty, biting satire to all forms of traditional authority, especially the Catholic Church. From Scotland, pioneer economist Adam Smith attacked mercantilism, the basis of Britain’s imperial trade policy. Enlightenment ideas spread when the violence and brutality of religious wars discredited the churches’ dogmatism and made theological controversies seem increasingly irrelevant to philosophers and their followers. In all the leading cities of Europe and America, these educated people gathered in coffeehouses, debating societies, and salons to discuss ideas in a new public sphere, uncontrolled by church or royal authority. Some dared to hope that earthly suffering was not inevitable and that reason and education could improve the human condition. Despising superstition and raw emotion, Enlightenment thinkers made the word “enthusiasm” one of the most negative terms in their vocabulary. Admiring the harmony that early scientists found in nature, they favored balance, calm, order, and uniformity in art and literature. They encouraged the direct observation of the natural world and cheered Benjamin Franklin’s famous experiments with electricity. Political thinkers celebrated the balance of the British constitution and insisted that colonial government replicate its virtues. The Enlightenment was an inspiration to optimistic reformers on both sides of the Atlantic, but its emphasis on science and reason necessarily limited its appeal to the educated few. Some followers of the Enlightenment became deists. Using Newton’s findings to compare the universe to a clock, they saw God as the clockmaker who created the world, gave it natural laws, and allowed it to run freely. Deists believed that human reason could discover the laws of nature and morality without religious guidance, and often condemned “priestcraft” as superstitious and fanatical. Without endorsing any sect, they favored toleration for all since persecution could never change anyone’s mind. Even some ministers approached deism, particularly in the more prestigious and well-established churches, and tried to explain Christianity by rational proof instead of spiritual conviction or biblical authority. Deism became the favorite philosophical --- stance of the Enlightenment’s most eminent representatives, from the distinguished philosophers of France to Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and other leaders of the American Revolution. ### THE GREAT AWAKENING While the “better sort” flirted with deism, rekindled faith warmed more ordinary Americans. Beginning in the 1730s and continuing through the 1760s, a wave of renewed religious intensity swept through the Protestant Atlantic world. Renewed spiritual fervor and personal conviction gripped the German churches in a movement known as Pietism. The brothers John and Charles Wesley led a Methodist movement to revive personal piety in the Church of England that later became a separate denomination. Americans experienced a wave of religious revivals known as the Great Awakening. Leaders in all these movements visited and corresponded with one another frequently and supported similar goals. Colonial prosperity had allowed American churches to grow and spread in the eighteenth-century. New towns in northern and western New England included new Congregational churches. German migration brought Lutheran, German Reformed, and Pietist churches to the middle colonies, and the Scots-Irish took Presbyterianism wherever they went. Plantation exports paid for a wave of new Anglican parishes in southern colonies from Maryland to South Carolina. Growth brought diversity; a 1771 image of New York City depicts 18 houses of worship, including a prominent Anglican church, a Jewish synagogue, and an Anabaptist meetinghouse, for its 25,000 inhabitants. Despite the influence of deism, eighteenth-century Americans had clearly not abandoned religion. A handful of especially zealous ministers still feared that religious devotion had slackened. A generation after the Halfway Covenant, many young New Englanders still lacked life-changing conversions and could not assume full membership in their churches. Despite their best efforts, moreover, established denominations could not keep up with population growth. Many backcountry districts lacked worship facilities, and eastern clergy worried that their inhabitants lived in lawlessness and sin. From his pulpit in Northampton, Massachusetts, the Reverend Jonathan Edwards began to strike back in the 1730s. A brilliant philosopher and theologian who shared the Enlightenment’s respect for --- human reason, Edwards was also a practical preacher who worried about the coldness of his flock. Fearing that logic could never warm them, he used terror instead. "The God that holds you over the pit of hell, much as one holds a spider or some loathsome insect over the fire, abhors you, and is dreadfully provoked," he reminded the unconverted sinner. "His wrath towards you burns like fire; he looks upon you as worthy of nothing else but to be cast into the fire." Edwards spoke calmly and without gestures, but the solemnity of his bearing only magnified the horror of his words. In the tradition of Puritan jeremiads, his sermons launched an emotional revival in the 1730s that brought tears, shrieks, and fainting spells to his anguished and penitent listeners. Conversions increased dramatically, and word of Edwards's extraordinary preaching spread widely. Other preachers followed quickly. Also in the 1730s, William Tennent Sr. and his sons, William Jr., Charles, John, and Gilbert, set a blaze among Scots-Irish Presbyterians in the middle colonies. Samuel Davies did the same in Virginia. The most renowned preacher of the Great Awakening was the Reverend George Whitefield, an Anglican missionary with Methodist leanings who repeatedly toured the colonies between 1739 and his death, preaching to immense crowds outdoors. Convinced that mere logic could never crack a hardened heart, Whitefield and the other revivalists appealed to emotions over abstract reason. During Whitefield's visit to Philadelphia, Benjamin Franklin remembered that "it was wonderful to see the Change soon made in the Manners of our inhabitants; From being thoughtless or indifferent about Religion, it seem'd as if all the World were growing Religious; so that one could not walk thro' the Town in an Evening without Hearing Psalms sung in different Families of every Street." Inspired by Edwards, Whitefield, and the Tennents, dozens of lesser preachers fanned across the colonies. Known as itinerants, the revivalists constantly traveled from one community to another and often accused more settled ministers of neglecting the genuine gospel to drone lifeless dogma in empty meetinghouses. They preached in fields or packed houses, everywhere declaring that stale, superficial worship meant nothing, that the people were drenched in sin, that they must repent and seek forgiveness, and that joyous salvation awaited those who sincerely did so. Like the Puritans, they stressed the importance of personal conversion, a theological stance that is often called evangelical. Without explicitly renouncing predestination, the itinerants undermined it by hinting that everyone who truly sought --- God would find Him. Timing of the Awakening varied from place to place, peaking in the 1740s in New England, and continuing into the 1750s in the South and elsewhere. Almost everywhere they traveled, the itinerants won hundreds, even thousands, of weeping, joyful converts who flocked to join old churches or form new ones. Evangelicals insisted on strict standards of personal conduct that drew sharp lines between their followers and “the world.” When mainstream clergy rejected their methods, the evangelicals broke away and split Protestants between New Light supporters and Old Light opponents of revivalism. In New England, the two factions quarreled bitterly over public funds to support their churches. Throughout the colonies, evangelicalism invigorated Baptists, Presbyterians, and, later, Methodists, while Anglicans, Quakers, and Old Light Congregationalists languished. The denominations linked to New Light evangelism would eventually become the leading Protestant churches of the United States. By opening salvation to everyone, the Great Awakening democratized religion and especially appealed to Americans who did not share the prosperity around them. Denouncing drunkenness, gambling, dancing, card playing, theatergoing, and sexual misconduct, evangelicals won few converts in the upper classes but offered a sober, serious life to humble folk who wearied of disorderly social change. Women and young people converted more readily than older men, the “middling” and “lower” sorts were more receptive than the wealthy, and the first large wave of African Americans entered the Christian churches. Everywhere, revivalists exalted humble converts beyond their rank in worldly society. As Baptist preacher Isaac Backus put it, “The common people now claim as good a right to judge and act in matters of religion as civil rulers or the learned clergy.” Superficially, the Enlightenment and the Great Awakening seemed to have little in common. Intellectuals mocked what they called the “enthusiasm” of self-taught preachers whose pulpit thunder exceeded their formal learning, just as the roughhewn itinerants knew little of Isaac Newton. Fundamentally, however, both movements stressed the importance of direct personal experience as a measure of the truth. For the Enlightenment scientist or statesman, observable facts could overrule tradition. New Lights encouraged believers to reject all religious authorities except the Bible, to think for themselves religiously, and to value a personal sensation of salvation over the bookish debates of the Old Lights. Together, the Enlightenment and the Great Awaken- --- ing challenged Americans to test received tradition by the light of personal experience, and authorized them to build their lives and institutions according to their own understandings of the truth. The personal test of truth led easily to religious clashes, especially when New Lights cited their own insights to attack Old Light religious authorities, and both sides battled over limited public funds. Influenced by deistic distaste for sectarian disputes, pragmatic politicians would eventually decide that the best solution was to disestablish the churches and cut off public funding in the name of religious freedom. They would also use Enlightenment reasoning to advance “self-evident truths” about government. In the second half of the eighteenth century, the Enlightenment and the Awakening both had profound effects on American views of public liberty. * Developments in the eighteenth century had brought a new population to the English colonies and accelerated the evolution of distinctive regional societies. The expansion of slavery marked the southern colonies as slave societies, while New England and the middle colonies combined commercial and subsistence farming with the growth of towns and handicrafts. Despite these unique regional features, however, growth and stability brought the colonies closer to prevailing patterns of English society and culture, and opened them to such transatlantic movements as the consumer revolution, the Enlightenment, and the Great Awakening. Prosperity and cultural diversity also fostered differences of opinion and public debates, especially in towns and cities where taverns, docks, and squares formed a public sphere between the chambers of government and the privacy of home. As the colonists passed the half-century mark, few had any idea that their increasing similarity to the mother country might also lead to increasing imperial tension. --- # CHAPTER 5 ## The Era of Independence, 1756–1783 On the afternoon of May 30, 1765, Virginia’s House of Burgesses had nearly finished its spring session, and most of its members had gone home, but one important issue still remained. Virginians had recently learned that the British Parliament had adopted a stamp tax for the American colonies. The law would require an expensive stamp for almost every kind of official paperwork, from a bill of sale to a court decision to a marriage license. Newspapers, college diplomas, and playing cards would carry costly stamps as well. The proceeds would pay for an army of 10,000 men—supposedly to guard the frontier, but perhaps for suppressing political dissent. Virginians disliked all taxes, but they truly hated the Stamp Act because it came from Parliament, not their own assembly. It thus sought to tax Virginians without the consent of their representatives and, in their view, violated the British constitution. The House of Burgesses had protested when the Stamp Act was only a rumor, but Parliament paid no attention. Now would the assembly truckle to Parliament’s authority? House leaders thought quiet objections would be most effective, but one freshman member felt otherwise. Patrick Henry was a 29-year-old attorney from the rural piedmont who had just won a popular and successful court case against British efforts to control the salaries of Anglican clergy. Rewarded with his first assembly seat, Henry became a firebrand for American rights, most remembered for his later slogan “Give me liberty, or give me death!” Henry introduced five resolutions of protest. The first four declared that the colonists had kept their English rights when they came to Virginia, that royal charters had confirmed these rights, that Englishmen could not be taxed without their consent, and that neither could Vir- --- The Bloody Massacre perpetrated in King Street, Boston, on March 5, 1770, by a party of the 29th Regt.

Later rescinded by the House of Burgesses, a more radical fifth resolution warned that colonial taxation by Parliament could “destroy British as well as American Freedom.” Everyone later agreed that Henry made a fiery speech, but accounts differed over what he said. In 1810, patriotic biographer William Wirt gave stirring details. “Caesar had his Brutus,” he had Henry say, “Charles the first, his Cromwell—and George the third—” and then the Speaker of the House of Burgesses interrupted. “‘Treason!’ cried the speaker—‘treason, treason,’ echoed from every part of the house.” Would the rash young lawyer physically threaten his august sovereign? No. In Wirt’s account, Henry recovered brilliantly. “And George the third . . . ,” he concluded, “‘*may profit by their example*. If *this* be treason, make the most of it.’” Wirt’s version has thrilled patriots since he wrote it, but other evidence gives different details. In a diary that surfaced later, a visitor who heard the speech reported that Henry backed down when listeners cried “treason.” “If he had affronted the speaker or the house, he was ready to ask pardon,” he explained, and pledged to support the king “at the Expence of the last Drop of his blood.” Unlike Wirt, the only recorded eyewitness mixed Henry’s defiance with apologies. These dueling stories illustrate the challenge of conflicting historical evidence, but they also reflect the hesitation and ambivalence that Patrick Henry and other Americans felt as they challenged the empire of Great Britain. Most white Americans were of British descent, they drew their political principles from English history, and they reverenced the king as protector of his people and their liberties. The Stamp Act was imposed by Parliament, not King George, but Henry denounced the king and linked his name to history’s most famous king-killers because history taught Virginians that kings always threatened liberty more than legislatures. Even so, cutting their ties to Britain would not be easy. Patrick Henry retreated a bit, but his resolutions made a greater impact than he anticipated. Garbled newspaper reports made his resolutions seem more radical than they were, and other assemblies then hastened to match or exceed Virginia’s stance. Taking their cue from legislators, violent mobs continued the fight and made the Stamp Act unenforceable throughout the colonies. The American War for Independence began as a quarrel over taxes that was launched in colonial assemblies by men like Patrick Henry, carried to the streets by violent mobs, and finally decided in battle. The --- dispute began when officials decided that the empire needed central direction and Americans should pay more of its expenses. Carried to extremes, the new policy could take control of the colonies from men like Patrick Henry and give it to London officials. The House of Burgesses was thus defending its own interests when protesting the Stamp Act, but torrents of rhetoric like Henry’s suggest that its constitutional objections to “taxation without representation” were not feigned or consciously hypocritical. Like Patrick Henry, moreover, the other burgesses struggled to balance their constitutional principles and their loyalty to Britain. The men who made the speeches did not win independence by themselves. They needed volunteers and willing sacrifice. For popular support, they touched the convictions of middling and poorer Americans, and linked legal theories to practical realities. To defend their own privileges, they empowered ordinary freemen and launched a movement that continued long after fighting had stopped. Their principles eventually spread to Americans they had not meant to reach, beginning with common white men and stretching to African Americans and women. In the process, a war for independence became truly revolutionary. ## Imperial War and Its Consequences Henry’s resolutions marked a looming crisis in the long relationship between Britain and its colonies that followed yet another war between Britain and France. British victory in a worldwide struggle called the Seven Years’ War (1756–1763), known in the colonies as the French and Indian War, had expelled France from the North American mainland, giving Canada and Florida to Britain and Louisiana to Spain. The war had nearly bankrupted the British treasury, however, and further expenses lay ahead. Efforts to cover these costs sparked a bitter and escalating controversy. ### THE SEVEN YEARS’ WAR Unlike most of the eighteenth-century conflicts between Britain and France, the Seven Years’ War began in America and then spread to Europe, Asia, and Africa as the two empires struggled for global supremacy. The immediate issue was the Ohio River Valley, a rich source of furs that the British wanted for future expansion and the French --- wanted in order to stop them. Indians wanted to keep it from both empires because they lived there. Other issues concerned the balance of power in Europe and commercial dominance worldwide. Britain and France had long clashed over these issues, most recently in King George’s War (known in Europe as the War of Austrian Succession, 1740–1748) but had not settled the fundamental questions. Following King George’s War, Britain and France began preparing for the next conflict by adding more Indian alliances, new forts, and additional trading posts in the Ohio country. Hoping to settle the area, the Crown granted 200,000 acres in 1749 to the Ohio Company, a group of Virginia land speculators. They had seven years to build a fort and establish 100 families at the Forks of the Ohio, where the Monongahela and Allegheny Rivers join to form the Ohio River at the modern site of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Exploration and construction began, but progress was slow and France
