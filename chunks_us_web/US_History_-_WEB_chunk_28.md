of the United States as an agrarian republic in which yeomen farmers worked the land. Jefferson also wanted to bolster trade in the West, seeing the port of New Orleans and the Mississippi River (then the western boundary of the United States) as crucial to American agricultural commerce. In his mind, farmers would send their --- produce down the Mississippi River to New Orleans, where it would be sold to European traders. The purchase of Louisiana came about largely because of circumstances beyond Jefferson‚Äôs control, though he certainly recognized the implications of the transaction. Until 1801, Spain had controlled New Orleans and had given the United States the right to traffic goods in the port without paying customs duties. That year, however, the Spanish had ceded Louisiana (and New Orleans) to France. In 1802, the United States lost its right to deposit goods free in the port, causing outrage among many, some of whom called for war with France. Jefferson instructed Robert Livingston, the American envoy to France, to secure access to New Orleans, sending James Monroe to France to add additional pressure. The timing proved advantageous. Because enslaved Black people in the French colony of Haiti had successfully overthrown the brutal plantation regime, Napoleon could no longer hope to restore the empire lost with France‚Äôs defeat in the French and Indian War (1754‚Äì1763). His vision of Louisiana and the Mississippi Valley as the source for food for Haiti, the most profitable sugar island in the world, had failed. The emperor therefore agreed to the sale in early 1803. üß≠ **CLICK AND EXPLORE** Explore the collected maps and documents relating to the Louisiana Purchase and its history at the [Library of Congress (https://openstax.org/l/LaPurchase)] site. The true extent of the United States‚Äô new territory remained unknown (Figure 8.14). Would it provide the long-sought quick access to Asian markets? Geographical knowledge was limited; indeed, no one knew precisely what lay to the west or how long it took to travel from the Mississippi to the Pacific. Jefferson selected two fellow Virginians, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, to lead an expedition to the new western lands. Their purpose was to discover the commercial possibilities of the new land and, most importantly, potential trade routes. From 1804 to 1806, Lewis and Clark traversed the West. <table> <thead> <tr> <th colspan="2">FIGURE 8.14</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>(a)</td> <td>(b)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>This 1804 map shows the territory added to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803.</td> <td>Contemporary map showing the United States with the Louisiana Purchase territory highlighted.</td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2">Compare this depiction to the contemporary map.

Of 176 electoral votes cast, all but 14 were in his favor. The great expansion of the United States did have its critics, however, especially northerners who feared the addition of more slave states and a corresponding lack of representation of their interests in the North. And under a strict interpretation of the Constitution, it remained unclear whether the president had the power to add territory in this fashion. But the vast majority of citizens cheered the increase in the size of the republic. For slaveholders, new western lands would be a boon; for their captives, the Louisiana Purchase threatened to entrench their suffering further. --- # 8.4 The United States Goes Back to War ### LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: * Describe the causes and consequences of the War of 1812 * Identify the important events of the War of 1812 and explain their significance The origins of the War of 1812, often called the Second War of American Independence, are found in the unresolved issues between the United States and Great Britain. One major cause was the British practice of impressment, whereby American sailors were taken at sea and forced to fight on British warships; this issue was left unresolved by Jay‚Äôs Treaty in 1794. In addition, the British in Canada supported Native Americans in their fight against further U.S. expansion in the Great Lakes region. Though Jefferson wanted to avoid what he called ‚Äúentangling alliances,‚Äù staying neutral proved impossible. ### THE EMBARGO OF 1807 France and England, engaged in the Napoleonic Wars, which raged between 1803 and 1815, both declared open season on American ships, which they seized on the high seas. England was the major offender, since the Royal Navy, following a time-honored practice, ‚Äúimpressed‚Äù American sailors by forcing them into its service. The issue came to a head in 1807 when the HMS *Leopard*, a British warship, fired on a U.S. naval ship, the *Chesapeake*, off the coast of Norfolk, Virginia. The British then boarded the ship and took four sailors. Jefferson chose what he thought was the best of his limited options and responded to the crisis through the economic means of a sweeping ban on trade, the Embargo Act of 1807. This law prohibited American ships from leaving their ports until Britain and France stopped seizing them on the high seas. As a result of the embargo, American commerce came to a near-total halt. The logic behind the embargo was that cutting off all trade would so severely hurt Britain and France that the seizures at sea would end. However, while the embargo did have some effect on the British economy, it was American commerce that actually felt the brunt of the impact (Figure 8.15). The embargo hurt American farmers, who could no longer sell their goods overseas, and seaport cities experienced a huge increase in unemployment and an uptick in bankruptcies. All told, American business activity declined by 75 percent from 1808 to 1809. <table> <thead> <tr> <th colspan="2">FIGURE 8.15</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td colspan="2">In this political cartoon from 1807, a snapping turtle (holding a shipping license) grabs a smuggler in the act of sneaking a barrel of sugar to a British ship.

Smuggling was widespread; Smugglers‚Äô Notch in Vermont, for example, earned its name from illegal trade with British Canada. Jefferson attributed the problems with the embargo to lax enforcement. --- At the very end of his second term, Jefferson signed the Non-Intercourse Act of 1808, lifting the unpopular embargoes on trade except with Britain and France. In the election of 1808, American voters elected another Democratic-Republican, James Madison. Madison inherited Jefferson‚Äôs foreign policy issues involving Britain and France. Most people in the United States, especially those in the West, saw Great Britain as the major problem. ### TECUMSEH AND THE WESTERN CONFEDERACY Another underlying cause of the War of 1812 was British support for native resistance to U.S. western expansion. For many years, White settlers in the American western territories had besieged the Native Americans living there. Under Jefferson, two policies existed: forcing Native Americans to adopt American ways of agricultural life, or aggressively driving them into debt in order to force them to sell their lands. In 1809, Tecumseh, a Shawnee war chief, rejuvenated the Western Confederacy. His brother, Tenskwatawa, was a prophet among the Shawnee who urged a revival of native ways and rejection of Anglo-American culture, including alcohol. In 1811, William Henry Harrison, the governor of the Indiana Territory, attempted to eliminate the native presence by attacking Prophetstown, a Shawnee settlement named in honor of Tenskwatawa. In the ensuing Battle of Tippecanoe, U.S. forces led by Harrison destroyed the settlement (Figure 8.16). They also found ample evidence that the British had supplied the Western Confederacy with weapons, despite the stipulations of earlier treaties. ---- **FIGURE 8.16** Portrait (a), painted by Charles Bird King in 1820, is a depiction of Shawnee prophet Tenskwatawa. Portrait (b) is Rembrandt Peele‚Äôs 1813 depiction of William Henry Harrison. What are the significant similarities and differences between the portraits? What was each artist trying to convey? ---- ### THE WAR OF 1812 The seizure of American ships and sailors, combined with the British support of Native American resistance, led to strident calls for war against Great Britain. The loudest came from the ‚Äúwar hawks,‚Äù led by Henry Clay from Kentucky and John C. Calhoun from South Carolina, who would not tolerate British insults to American honor. Opposition to the war came from Federalists, especially those in the Northeast, who knew war would disrupt the maritime trade on which they depended. In a narrow vote, Congress authorized the president to declare war against Britain in June 1812. The war went very badly for the United States at first. In August 1812, the United States lost Detroit to the British and their Native allies, including a force of one thousand men led by Tecumseh. By the end of the year, the British controlled half the Northwest. The following year, however, U.S. forces scored several victories. Captain Oliver Hazard Perry and his naval force defeated the British on Lake Erie. At the Battle of the Thames in Ontario, the United States defeated the British and their native allies, and Tecumseh was counted among the --- dead. Native American resistance began to ebb, opening the Indiana and Michigan territories for White settlement. These victories could not turn the tide of the war, however. With the British gaining the upper hand during the Napoleonic Wars and Napoleon‚Äôs French army on the run, Great Britain now could divert skilled combat troops from Europe to fight in the United States. In July 1814, forty-five hundred hardened British soldiers sailed up the Chesapeake Bay and burned Washington, DC, to the ground, forcing President Madison and his wife to run for their lives (Figure 8.17). According to one report, they left behind a dinner the British officers ate. That summer, the British shelled Baltimore, hoping for another victory. However, they failed to dislodge the U.S. forces, whose survival of the bombardment inspired Francis Scott Key to write ‚ÄúThe Star-Spangled Banner.‚Äù [The image shows a painting of The President‚Äôs House shortly after the War of 1812, ca. 1814‚Äì1815, depicting the result of the British burning of Washington, DC.] **FIGURE 8.17** George Munger painted *The President‚Äôs House* shortly after the War of 1812, ca. 1814‚Äì1815. The painting shows the result of the British burning of Washington, DC. ---- ### AMERICANA **Francis Scott Key‚Äôs ‚ÄúIn Defense of Fort McHenry‚Äù** After the British bombed Baltimore‚Äôs Fort McHenry in 1814 but failed to overcome the U.S. forces there, Francis Scott Key was inspired by the sight of the American flag, which remained hanging proudly in the aftermath. He wrote the poem ‚ÄúIn Defense of Fort McHenry,‚Äù which was later set to the tune of a British song called ‚ÄúThe Anacreontic Song‚Äù and eventually became the U.S. national anthem, ‚ÄúThe Star-Spangled Banner.‚Äù > Oh, say, can you see, by the dawn‚Äôs early light, > What so proudly we hailed at the twilight‚Äôs last gleaming? > Whose broad stripes and bright stars, thru the perilous fight, > O‚Äôer the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming? > And the rockets‚Äô red glare, the bombs bursting in air, > Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. > O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave > O‚Äôer the land of the free and the home of the brave? > > On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep, > Where the foe‚Äôs haughty host in dread silence reposes, > What is that which the breeze, o‚Äôer the towering steep, > As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses? > Now it catches the gleam of the morning‚Äôs first beam, > In full glory reflected, now shines on the stream: > Tis the star-spangled banner: O, long may it wave > O‚Äôer the land of the free and the home of the brave! --- > And where is that band who so vauntingly swore > That the havoc of war and the battle‚Äôs confusion > A home and a country should leave us no more? > Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps‚Äô pollution. > No refuge could save the hireling and slave > From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave: > And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave > O‚Äôer the land of the free and the home of the brave. > > O, thus be it ever when freemen shall stand, > Between their loved home and the war‚Äôs desolation! > Blest with victory and peace, may the heav‚Äôn-rescued land > Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation! > Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just, > And this be our motto: ‚ÄúIn God is our trust‚Äù > And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave > O‚Äôer the land of the free and the home of the brave! > ‚ÄîFrancis Scott Key, ‚ÄúIn Defense of Fort McHenry,‚Äù 1814 What images does Key use to describe the American spirit?

In 1814, British and U.S. diplomats met in Flanders, in northern Belgium, to negotiate the Treaty of Ghent, signed in December. The boundaries between the United States and British Canada remained as they were before the war, an outcome welcome to those in the United States who feared a rupture in the country‚Äôs otherwise steady expansion into the West. The War of 1812 was very unpopular in New England because it inflicted further economic harm on a region dependent on maritime commerce. This unpopularity caused a resurgence of the Federalist Party in New England. Many Federalists deeply resented the power of the slaveholding Virginians (Jefferson and then Madison), who appeared indifferent to their region. The depth of the Federalists‚Äô discontent is illustrated by the proceedings of the December 1814 Hartford Convention, a meeting of twenty-six Federalists in Connecticut, where some attendees issued calls for New England to secede from the United States. These arguments for disunion during wartime, combined with the convention‚Äôs condemnation of the government, made Federalists appear unpatriotic. The convention forever discredited the Federalist Party and led to its downfall. ### EPILOGUE: THE BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS Due to slow communication, the last battle in the War of 1812 happened after the Treaty of Ghent had been signed ending the war. Andrew Jackson had distinguished himself in the war by defeating the Creek Natives in March 1814 before invading Florida in May of that year. After taking Pensacola, he moved his force of Tennessee fighters to New Orleans to defend the strategic port against British attack. On January 8, 1815 (despite the official end of the war), a force of battle-tested British veterans of the --- Napoleonic Wars attempted to take the port. Jackson‚Äôs forces devastated the British, killing over two thousand. New Orleans and the vast Mississippi River Valley had been successfully defended, ensuring the future of American settlement and commerce. The Battle of New Orleans immediately catapulted Jackson to national prominence as a war hero, and in the 1820s, he emerged as the head of the new Democratic Party. --- # Key Terms **Bill of Rights** the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution, which guarantee individual rights **Citizen Gen√™t affair** the controversy over the French representative who tried to involve the United States in France‚Äôs war against Great Britain **Democratic-Republicans** advocates of limited government who were troubled by the expansive domestic policies of Washington‚Äôs administration and opposed the Federalists **impressment** the practice of capturing sailors and forcing them into military service **letters of marque** French warrants allowing ships and their crews to engage in piracy **Louisiana Purchase** the U.S. purchase of the large territory of Louisiana from France in 1803 **Marbury v.

While many of the Anti-Federalists‚Äô fears were assuaged by the adoption of the Bill of Rights in 1791, the early 1790s nevertheless witnessed the rise of two political parties: the Federalists and the Democratic-Republicans. These rival political factions began by defining themselves in relationship to Hamilton‚Äôs financial program, a debate that exposed contrasting views of the proper role of the federal government. By championing Hamilton‚Äôs bold financial program, Federalists, including President Washington, made clear their intent to use the federal government to stabilize the national economy and overcome the financial problems that had plagued it since the 1780s. Members of the Democratic-Republican opposition, however, deplored the expanded role of the new national government. They argued that the Constitution did not permit the treasury secretary‚Äôs expansive program and worried that the new national government had assumed powers it did not rightfully possess. Only on the question of citizenship was there broad agreement: only free, White males who met taxpayer or property qualifications could cast ballots as full citizens of the republic. ## 8.2 The New American Republic Federalists and Democratic-Republicans interpreted the execution of the French monarch and the violent establishment of a French republic in very different ways. Revolutionaries‚Äô excesses in France and the slave revolt in the French colony of Haiti raised fears among Federalists of similar radicalism and slave uprisings on American shores. They looked to better relationships with Great Britain through Jay‚Äôs Treaty. Pinckney‚Äôs Treaty, which came about as a result of Jay‚Äôs Treaty, improved U.S. relations with the Spanish and opened the Spanish port of New Orleans to American commerce. Democratic-Republicans took a more positive view of the French Revolution and grew suspicious of the Federalists when they brokered Jay‚Äôs Treaty. Domestically, the partisan divide came to a dramatic head in western Pennsylvania when distillers of whiskey, many aligned with the Democratic-Republicans, took action against the federal tax on their product. Washington led a massive force to put down the uprising, demonstrating Federalist intolerance of mob action. Though divided on many issues, the majority of White citizens agreed on the necessity of eradicating the Native presence on the frontier. --- ## 8.3 Partisan Politics Partisan politics dominated the American political scene at the close of the eighteenth century. The Federalists‚Äô and Democratic-Republicans‚Äô views of the role of government were in direct opposition to each other, and the close elections of 1796 and 1801 show how the nation grappled with these opposing visions. The high tide of the Federalist Party came after the election of 1796, when the United States engaged in the Quasi-War with France. The issues arising from the Quasi-War gave Adams and the Federalists license to expand the powers of the federal government. However, the tide turned with the close election of 1800, when Jefferson began an administration based on Democratic-Republican ideals. A major success of Jefferson‚Äôs administration was the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, which helped to fulfill his vision of the United States as an agrarian republic. ## 8.4 The United States Goes Back to War The United States was drawn into its ‚ÄúSecond War of Independence‚Äù against Great Britain when the British, engaged in the Napoleonic Wars against France, took liberties with the fledgling nation by impressing (capturing) its sailors on the high seas and arming its Native enemies. The War of 1812 ended with the boundaries of the United States remaining as they were before the war. The Native peoples in the Western Confederacy suffered a significant defeat, losing both their leader Tecumseh and their fight for contested land in the Northwest. The War of 1812 proved to be of great importance because it generated a surge of national pride, with expressions of American identity such as the poem
